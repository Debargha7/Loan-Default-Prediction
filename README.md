# Loan-Default-Prediction

Regarding the problem,i started by importing the necessary libraries and the dataset.On checking or missing values i removed the columns which had >50% of missing values.But still then there were some variables with a few missing values.So i dropped those rows having the missing values.Here the main target variable was loan status,which had more than  categories.So i had tried to make it a binary variable by classifying it as good loans and bad loans.Good loans means those which will never default whereas bad loans meant that they have either defaulted or can default.I label encoded some of the categorical variables.I also did some analysis on some varaibles  and decided to drop them from the analysis as they were of no significance.Some of the variables were subsets of the other so i also dropped them.I did some EDA on some features and regarding their relation to the target variable.As the dataset was an imbalanced one i used pycaret to build a model.Pycaret had by deault a feature o one hot encoding the nominal categorical variables and also i passed the parameters to scale the data and also select the important features from the dataset.I compared among 6 models out of which xgboost model was the better one as it had a better recall,precision,f1 and kappa score than the others.I could not consider accuracy as it was an imbalanced dataset.

From the dataset i can understand that we can allot credit scores to the borrowers regarding their current loan status , between which dates they are repaying their loans.
